# LED Chaser Project - A Simple Christmas Ornament

I made this LED chaser as a guided project for Hack Club Blueprint. It has 10 LEDs that flash in sequence. I chose to make it an ornament, since Christmas is just around the corner, and I figured it would be cool to have on my family's tree. :)

Made for Hack Club Blueprint.
